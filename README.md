## About zstyle

zstyle is a utility-first styling library for React Native largely inspired by [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:
```bash
npm install react-native-zstyle --save
```

Then copy the 'zstyle.js' file into the root folder of your React Native project:

```bash
cp ./node_modules/react-native-zstyle/src/zstyle.js .
```

zstyle comes with standard utilities out of the box with some of them being customisable such as colors, margins, paddings, etc... 

The 'zstyle.js' file is the place to setup all your customs styling utilities that will be available in the Z components everywhere in your project.

## Documentation

A first version of the official documentation is available here: [react-native-zstyle.com](https://react-native-zstyle.com/)

This documentation is explaining the concept of the library as well as listing all availble utilities.

This is a work in progress it still need to get styling examples you can achieve with zstyle.
